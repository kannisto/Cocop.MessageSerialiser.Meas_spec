    In this file: a data record with empty content.
    The SWE XML schema requires at least one field in a data record.
    Therefore, any applications creating data records should never generate
    an empty data record but instead add the field specified in this document. 
    However, when reading, it is advisable to accept even empty records.
    
    When a client receives a document like this, it should consider the enclosed 
    data record empty.
    
    This file has no particular focus on observation metadata.
