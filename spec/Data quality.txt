Good data quality is specified using the following string values. If a quality string starts with that string, the quality is always considered good.

good


Bad data quality starts with the following string.

bad


Please note that if there is a need to add an indication why the quality is bad, the string may be continued (see below). However, there is no specification about how to indicate each specific reason.

bad/equipmentfailure


NOTE: the data quality string *must not* contain any whitespace characters!
